# chapter08

In the [Info1](https://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/info1) class, we will use
a (Bad) Zuul version with unit tests, 
which you can find in [https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise09-zuul](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise09-zuul).

Thus, this repo is **not necessary** for
 the [info1](https://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/info1) class, 
but you can use it as reference for the first refactoring. 
[6th-ed-complete](6th-ed-complete) contains the original examples
from the book.
